# Smart-Farming
This project is an IoT-based Smart Farming solution designed to monitor and automate essential agricultural processes. It collects real-time data from environmental sensors and makes intelligent decisions to optimize water usage, soil health, and crop productivity.
ESP32-based System: Handles sensor data collection and communication.
Soil Moisture Monitoring: Tracks real-time moisture levels in the soil.
Automated Irrigation: Controls water pumps based on soil moisture readings.
Temperature & Humidity Sensing: Monitors weather conditions using DHT11/DHT22.
Android App Integration: Displays sensor data and system status to users.
Power-Efficient Design: Built with low-power consumption in mind for remote areas.
